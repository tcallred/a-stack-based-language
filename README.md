# A Stack Based Language in Rust

This project is an experimental stack-based language like Forth. 

The goal was to try to implement it in as much of a pure functional style while utilizing ownership to allow for in-place mutation.
Eventually, I want to try to implement functions used in Array oriented languages such as APL.
